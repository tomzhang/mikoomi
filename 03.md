# MongoDB Plugin #


## Overview ##

The **MongoDB Plugin** can be used to monitor standalone, replicated as well as clustered MongoDB instances. The plugin monitors availability, resource utilization, health, performance and other important metrics of a MongoDB environment. Coupled with the Zabbix OS level monitoring, the MongoDB plugin provides great peace of mind knowing that MongoDB is being monitored 24x7 and sufficient data would be available for sizing, scalability, troubleshooting and support.


## Setup and Configuration ##

The MongoDB plugin uses the MongoDB PHP driver which needs to be installed on the Zabbix server.  For this, install and setup the following packages:
  * **php5-dev (or php5-devel)** = Files for PHP5 module development
  * **php5-pear** = PEAR - PHP Extension and Application Repository
  * **gcc** = GNU C Compiler
  * **make** = make utility

To install the above on a Zabbix appliance, login into the appliance as root (default password = zabbix) and run the following commands:
  * yast -i php5-devel
  * yast -i gcc
  * yast -i php5-pear
  * yast -i make

Now install the php MongoDB driver using the instructions at http://us2.php.net/manual/en/mongo.installation.php

In the case of the Zabbix appliance, run the the following pecl command:
  * pecl install mongo

After successful installation of the MongoDB driver, you need to "enable" it within php5. Edit the two files **/etc/php5/cli/php.ini and /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini** and add a line to the "Dynamic Extensions" sections as shown below.

```
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Dynamic Extensions ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

extension=mongo.so
```


Ensure that the php MongoDB driver is setup and configured properly by testing out one of the sample php programs for MongoDB driver (http://us2.php.net/manual/en/mongo.tutorial.php).

Download the MongoDB Plugin shell script and php file from http://mikoomi.googlecode.com/svn/plugins/ and copy them into /etc/zabbix/externalscripts directory on the Zabbix server. **Make sure that the php script and shell script are made executable.**

Next open up a browser and download the MongoDB Zabbix template.
Now login to the Zabbix frontend (user = admin, password = zabbix).

Navigate as follows:
  * Configuration >> Templates
  * Click on the "Import Template" button on the top right-hand corner
  * In the "Import file" dialog box, browse/search/enter the filename of the Zabbix template that was downloaded
  * Upload the template

**_Now you are ready to start monitoring your MongoDB servers !_**



## Monitoring a MongoDB Environment (single server, replicaset or cluster) ##

Follow these steps to start monitoring a MongoDB server
  * login to the Zabbix front-end and navigate to **_Configuration >> Hosts_**
  * Click on **_Create Host_** button on the top right-hand corner.
  * Fill in the details - where Name = your choice of name for the MongoDB server to be monitored
  * Next click on the **_Add_** button in the **_Linked templates_** section of the screen.
  * You will see a list of templates - select the template **_Template\_MongoDB_**

In the Macros section, add the following three macros -
  * **{$MONGODB\_HOSTNAME}** = Hostname or IP address of mongod or mongos process
  * **{$MONGODB\_PORT}** = Port number for mongod or mongos process
  * **{$MONGODB\_ZABBIX\_NAME}** = The hostname for the MongoDB server/instance as defined in Zabbix

Note that all the 3 macros above are required even if the defaults are used.

**Note that in a sharded and/or replicated MongoDB environment, you need to monitor only ONE of the mongos process**. However that process needs to be aware of the entire Mongo environment (or cluster) - i.e. all the shards and all the replicas within each replicaset.

Save the configuration and Zabbix should start collecting data within 60 seconds.

Data is collected by the template at intervals of 60 seconds for each monitored MonogoDB server/environment.

## Pre-canned Triggers ##
Triggers in Zabbix are events of interest that happen with respect to the monitored metrics. For example, the plugin keeps track of the total number of collections. If this count changes, it flags this event by firing a trigger. You can choose to ignore this trigger or you can choose to take an action - e.g. send an email or run a shell script.

The MongoDB plugin comes with the following built-in triggers:

  * One or more databases have been created
  * One or more databases have been destroyed
  * No Data Received in 5 minutes
  * One or more replication members need attention
  * One or more members have been removed from the ReplicaSet
  * One or more members have been added to the ReplicaSet
  * One or more new shard chunks have been created
  * One or more shards have been added to the cluster
  * One or more shards have been removed from the cluster
  * One or more new sharded collections have been created
  * One or more collections have been dropped
  * One or more collections have been added
  * One or more indexes have been dropped
  * One or more indexes have been added
