# Amzon EC2 Plugin #


## Overview ##

The **Amazon EC2 Plugin** can be used to monitor your EC2 instances, Elastic IPs, EBS volumes, snapshots and AMI images on Amazon's AWS Cloud. The plugin monitors the counts and state of your EC2 resources by querying the Amazon AWS API as well as keeps an eye on the Spot prices of EC2 instances. Because the plugin checks the status of your resources using the AWS API, no software or agent needs to be installed on your EC2 instances. Thus anytime you instantiate an EC2 instance, it is automatically "covered and monitored" by the plugin.

## Setup and Configuration ##

The Amazon EC2 plugin uses AWS REST API and does not require the AWS SDK. However it uses PHP and does need the following packages:
  * **php5-dev (or php5-devel)** = Files for PHP5 module development
  * **php5-pear** = PEAR - PHP Extension and Application Repository
  * **gcc** = GNU C Compiler
  * **make** = make utility
  * **php5-hash** = PHP hashing functions


To install the above on a Zabbix appliance, login into the appliance as root (default password = zabbix) and run the following commands:
  * yast -i php5-devel
  * yast -i gcc
  * yast -i php5-pear
  * yast -i make
  * yast -i php5-hash



Next download the Amazon EC2 Plugin shell script and php file from http://mikoomi.googlecode.com/svn/plugins/ and copy them into /etc/zabbix/externalscripts directory on the Zabbix server. **Make sure that the php script and shell script are made executable.**

Next open up a browser and download the MongoDB Zabbix template.
Now login to the Zabbix frontend (user = admin, password = zabbix).

Navigate as follows:
  * Configuration >> Templates
  * Click on the "Import Template" button on the top right-hand corner
  * In the "Import file" dialog box, browse/search/enter the filename of the Zabbix template that was downloaded
  * Upload the template

**_Now you are ready to start monitoring your Amazon Cloud instances, images, volumes, snapshots and elastic IPs!_**



## Monitoring Your Amazon AWS Cloud Resources ##

Follow these steps to start monitoring:
  * login to the Zabbix front-end and navigate to **_Configuration >> Hosts_**
  * Click on **_Create Host_** button on the top right-hand corner.
  * Fill in the details - where Name = your choice of name for collection of Amazon AWS EC2 resources to be monitored
  * Next click on the **_Add_** button in the **_Linked templates_** section of the screen.
  * You will see a list of templates - select the template **_Template\_Amazon\_AWS\_EC2_**

In the Macros section, add the following three macros -
  * **{$AWS\_ACCOUNT}**
  * **{$AWS\_ACCOUNT\_ACCESS\_KEY}**
  * **{$AWS\_ACCOUNT\_SECRET\_KEY}**


The value for {$AWS\_ACCOUNT} should be your Amazon EC2 account id. The value for {$AWS\_ACCOUNT\_ACCESS\_KEY} should be your AWS account access key and the value for {$AWS\_ACCOUNT\_SECRET\_KEY} should be the account access secret key. Note that you can get this informaton by logging into Amazon AWS and clicking on **_Account_** and then  **_Security Credentials_**.

## Pre-canned Triggers ##
Triggers in Zabbix are events of interest that happen with respect to the monitored metrics. For example, the plugin keeps track of the total number of instances. If this count changes, it flags this event by firing a trigger. You can choose to ignore this trigger or you can choose to take an action - e.g. send an email or run a shell script.

The Amazon EC2 plugin comes with the following built-in triggers:

  * No data received from EC2 overview plugin in the last 15 minutes
  * The number of running instances has increased
  * The number of running instances has decreased
  * The total number of running instances has decreased
  * The total number of running instances has increased
  * The total number of instances has increased
  * The total number of instances has decreased
  * The number of elastic IP addresss has increased
  * The number of elastic IP addresses has decreased
  * The number of reserved instances has increased
  * The number of reserved instances has decreased
  * One or more snapshots were successfully completed
  * A new snapshot has been created
  * One or more snapshots had errors
  * The number of self-owned snapshots has increased
  * The number of self-owned snapshots has decreased
  * The number of spot instances has increased
  * The number of spot instances has decreased
  * One or more volumes have been attached to instances
  * One or more volumes have been detached from instances
  * The number of available volumes has increased
  * The number of available volumes has decreased
