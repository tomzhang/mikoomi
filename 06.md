# Apache HBase Plugin #


## Overview ##

The **Apache HBase Plugin** is a Zabbix plugin that can be used to effortlessly monitor HBase clusters. [HBase](http://hbase.apache.org) is the leading distributed, big data processing datastore system on top of [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org) "out there". While it is used by companies like Yahoo (who supposedly have the largest Hadoop cluster), Facebook, Groupon to name a few, there seems to be only one single monitoring solution out there - [Ganglia](http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/GangliaMetrics) and [openTSDB](http://opentsdb.net/). As you read the documentation, you will realize that the two monitoring solutions are very tightly coupled to Hadoop and are very sensitive about its version, libraries, etc.

The Apache HBase plugin has been designed to be loosely coupled with the HBase cluster and does not require installing any software on the HBase cluster or the Zabbix server. Sounds too good to be true? Why don't you continue reading below......

## Setup and Configuration ##

The instructions below are geared for installing on a Zabbix appliance as available from [Zabbix](http://www.zabbix.com). If you have never "played" with Zabbix before, the appliance is the best way to become familiar. If you already have an existing Zabbix server, then you are already familiar with the Zabbix system and will easily be able to adopt the instructions to your environment. The only changes/deviations from the steps below would be the location for the mikoomi scripts - which is the directory specified for external scripts in your Zabbix server configuration file.

Note that Zabbix appliance and Zabbix server are used synonymously below.

The Apache HBase Plugin uses screen-scraping of the HBase Master Web UI interfaces. There is no need to add or change any HBase configuration parameters or restart your HBase cluster. You can be up and running in as little as 5 minutes after downloading the plugin on your Zabbix appliance or server.

The plugin makes use of a command tool called curl which needs to be installed. On the Zabbix appliance, you can do this by logging in as root (default password = zabbix) running the command **`yast -i curl`**. Note that yast will first update its own package repository and this takes a couple of minutes, but the curl package itself is quite small.

Next download the Apache HBase Plugin which consists of two shell scripts and a template xml file both of which can be downloaded from http://mikoomi.googlecode.com/svn/plugins/. Create a directory **`/etc/zabbix/externalscripts`** on the Zabbix server if it does not already exist and copy the shell scripts to that directory. Ensure that the scripts have execute permissions.

Next open up a browser and download the HBase Zabbix template file from http://mikoomi.googlecode.com/svn/plugins/.
Open up another browser window or tab and login to the Zabbix frontend (for the appliance, the default credentials are - user = admin, password = zabbix).

Navigate as follows:
  * Configuration >> Templates
  * Click on the "Import Template" button on the top right-hand corner
  * In the "Import file" dialog box, browse/search/enter the filename of the Mikoomi HBase template that was downloaded
  * Upload the template

_**Now you are ready to start monitoring your HBase cluster as described below.**

## Monitoring Your HBase Cluster ##_

Follow these steps to start monitoring:
  * login to the Zabbix front-end and navigate to **_Configuration >> Hosts_**
  * Click on **_Create Host_** button on the top right-hand corner.
  * Fill in the details - where Name = your choice of name for the HBase cluster (the name should not contain any spaces - it should be strictly alphanumeric and underscore characters)
  * Next click on the **_Add_** button in the **_Linked templates_** section of the screen.
  * You will see a list of templates - select the template **Template\_HBase**

In the Macros section, add the following three macros -
  * **{$HBASE\_MASTER\_HOST}**
  * **{$HBASE\_MASTER\_METRICS\_PORT}**
  * **{$ZABBIX\_NAME}**


The value for {$HBASE\_MASTER\_HOST} should be the hostname or IP of the Master node of your HBase cluster. Ensure that you can ping the Master using the same hostname or IP from the Zabbix server. The value for  {$HBASE\_MASTER\_METRICS\_PORT} should be the port on which the Master Admin UI Web Interface is available. And the value for {$ZABBIX\_NAME} is the name that was given to the HBase cluster in your Zabbix server.

That's all there is to start monitoring your HBase cluster!

THe Mikoomi Apache HBase plugin queries the cluster every 5 minutes - which has been found to be an optimal balance.

## Monitored Metrics ##
The APache HBase plugin collects over 300 metrics at each data collection cycle.
They can be grouped into two large categories - Regionserver-level and cluster-level metrics and table-level metrics.


Cluster-Level and Regionserver-level Metrics
These metrics include the following:
  * Block Cache Evicted Count
  * Block Cache Free Memory (MB)
  * Block Cache Hit Count
  * Block Cache Miss Count
  * Block Cache Size (MB)
  * Blocks in Block Cache
  * Compaction Queue Size
  * Flush Queue Size
  * Heap Memory Size (MB)
  * Memstore Size (MB)
  * Number of Nodes in HBase Cluster
  * Number of Regions
  * Number of Storefiles
  * Number of Stores
  * Number of Tables in HBase Cluster
  * Requests to Regionserver
  * Storefile Index Size (MB)
  * Storefile Size (MB)

The above metrics are collected for each regionserver in the HBase cluster. However to control data volume and prevent information overload, only the top 3, bottom 3, cluster-wide total and cluster-wide average values for each metric are maintained. This allows keeping track on the total activity across the cluster as well as the regionservers that are lightly as heavily stressed in terms of load, regions/storage, memory, etc.

Table-Level Metrics
Similarly, the following metrics are also collected at HBase table level, regionserver level and cluster-level total and average.
  * Table-level Memstore Size (MB)
  * Table-level Region Count
  * Table-level Storefile Index Size (MB)
  * Table-level Storefile Size (MB)
  * Table-level Storefiles
  * Table-level Stores

Like the regionserver metrics, these metrics are collected for each table and the top 3, bottom 3 and averages across all tables are made available as monitored metrics.

## Pre-canned Triggers ##
Triggers in Zabbix are events of interest that happen with respect to the monitored metrics. For example, the plugin keeps track of the total number of nodes in the cluster. If this count changes, it flags this event by firing a trigger. You can choose to ignore this trigger or you can choose to take an action - e.g. send an email or run a shell script.

Out of the box, the template comes with the following built-in trigger checks:
  * Average block cache evictions have been high for the past 1 hour (avg is 100% more as compared to the last 4 hours)
  * Average block cache misses have been high for the past 1 hour (avg is 100% more as compared to the last 4 hours)
  * Average queue size total has been high for the past 1 hour (avg is 100% more as compared to the last 4 hours)
  * Average regionserver requests have been high for the past 1 hour (avg is 100% more as compared to the last 4 hours)
  * Cluster-wide memstore size total has been high for the past 1 hour (avg total is 100% more as compared to the last 4 hours)
  * Cluster-wide number of regions has increased by 10% over the last 1 hour (as compared to the last 4 hours)
  * Cluster-wide number of storefiles has increased by 10% over the last 1 hour (as compared to the last 4 hours)
  * Cluster-wide number of stores has increased by 10% over the last 1 hour (as compared to the last 4 hours)
  * No monitoring data received for the last 10 minutes
  * One or more regionservers/nodes has been offlined/shutdown
  * One or more regionservers/nodes have been added/re-started/brought online
